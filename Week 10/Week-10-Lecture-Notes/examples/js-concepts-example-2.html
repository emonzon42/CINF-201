        <h1>JavaScript Examples</h1>
        <p>There are numerous JS examples on this page. To view the code, right-click the page and either View Source or Inspect Element. To see the actual ouptut, you'll need to open up the Web Tools (F12 or Inspect Element) and check the console tab. If there are ever any errors in your code, they will be present in the console tab (along with line numbers for the errors usually). In these examples, I've created a function called myFunction and then called it directly after. I also created a function with no name but it is tied to an "onclick" event which is triggered when the button is clicked.</p>
